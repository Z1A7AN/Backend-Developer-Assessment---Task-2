# Backend-Developer-Assessment-Task-2
This project provides a secure user authentication system built using Node.js and Express.js, focusing on cryptography and security practices. It implements robust password hashing using bcrypt to ensure user credentials are securely stored in the database. The system includes endpoints for user registration and login, with proper error handling and response messages. Additionally, it utilizes JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for session management and authorization.

The project aims to simplify the implementation of a secure authentication system while ensuring best practices for safeguarding user data.
